# Calculator Application

## Overview  
This project is part of the **BTEC Level 3 Diploma in Computing - Unit 16: Object-Oriented Programming**. The aim is to design and develop an object-oriented solution for a specific problem, demonstrating programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and the use of graphical user interfaces (GUI).  

For this task, I am building a **Calculator App** using **Python** and **Tkinter**, which will serve as an example of a functional GUI-based application.

## Project Objectives  
- **Problem Definition:**  
  Create a simple, interactive, and user-friendly calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

- **Purpose:**  
  To demonstrate object-oriented programming principles, GUI design, and error handling using Python.

## Features  
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**  
   Built using the Tkinter library, the calculator includes buttons for numbers (0-9) and operations (+, -, ร, รท).  

2. **Core Functionality:**  
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations.  
   - Display results on a screen.  
   - Clear/reset functionality.  

3. **Object-Oriented Design:**  
   The app follows object-oriented programming principles:
   - **Classes and Objects** are used to structure the program.  
   - **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism** are implemented to enhance flexibility and code reusability.

4. **Error Handling:**  
   Includes validation to handle division by zero and invalid inputs gracefully.

## How to Run the Application  
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  
2. Install Tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python).  
3. Run the `calculator.py` file using the following command:  
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
